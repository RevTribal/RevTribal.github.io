title:  Kharagpur Winter of Code 2016

short_desc:  Kharagpur Winter of Code is a one-month long open-source contribution fest organised by Kharagpur Open Source Society. As a mentor of 7 projects, it felt great to guide newbies of different skill-sets in contributing to the projects. This post aims to document all the proceedings in different projects that happened during KWoC 2016.

    December 2016 at Chennai , TamilNadu was pretty much as grim as the previous 
    December, with tragic death of Cheif Minister 
    [Jayalalithaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayalalithaa), followed by 
    [Cyclone Vardah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Vardah), that 
    devastated more than 30,000 trees and electricity. Amidst all these happening 
    in background, [Kharagpur Winter of Code 2016](http://kwoc.herokuapp.com/), 
    was probably the only optimistic thing happening around. Kharagpur Winter of 
    Code is a one-month long open-source contribution fest organised by 
    [Kharagpur Open Source Society](http://kossiitkgp.herokuapp.com/). As a 
    mentor of 7 projects, it felt great to guide newbies in contributing to the 
    projects. I have penned down below - my experiences and proceedings in 
    different projects that happened during KWoC 2016. 

    ---Project #1 - TV Series---

    ![TV series project](tvseries.png)

    TV Series ( [GitHub](https://github.com/athityakumar/tvseries) | 
    [Website](https://athityakumar.github.io/tvseries) ) is an aggregator of 
    Episode Synopsis' and ratings of different TV Series' spread across multiple 
    Wiki sources and IMDb rating. This involves Web Scraping, and writing the 
    scraped data into HTML files - to showcase the episodes with a neat user 
    interface. 

    - [Dhruv Apte](https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt) added Sherlock & Firefly 
    series' with 2 Pull requests.

    - [Anirudh Murali](https://github.com/AnirudhMurali) added Person of 
    Interest, Gotham and White Collar series' with 3 Pull Requests.

    - [Abhay Gurrala](https://github.com/abhay44) added Travis Continous 
    Integration support with 1 Pull Request.

    ---Project #2 - Naarad---

    ![Project Naarad](naarad.png)

    Naarad ( [GitHub](https://github.com/metakgp/naarad-source) | 
    [Website](https://naarad.metakgp.org/) ) is a news aggregator localized to 
    the students of IIT Kharagpur. That is, Naarad scrapes IIT Kharagpur 
    related posts from various IIT Kharagpur groups on facebook, to show them 
    all at one place. 

    - [Zishan Sami](https://github.com/zishansami102) fixed 2 issues with 2 
    Pull requests.
    - [Harshit](https://github.com/iamharshit) added Travis Continous 
    Integration with 1 Pull Request.
    - [Sayan Sinha](https://github.com/americast/) fixed an issue with 1 Pull Request.

    ---Project #3 - Faculty Scraper---

    The project name is quite self-explanatory. This project aims to keep 
    building a database of faculties from various Institutes across the world. 
    Have a look [here](https://github.com/barc-iitkgp/faculty-scraper) at the 
    resources aggregated so far.

    - [Dhruv Apte](https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt) added support for Princeton 
    faculty, Yale's CS faculty and UCSB faculty with 3 Pull Requests. 
    - [Sayan Ghosh](https://github.com/sgdgp) added support for CS faculty of UIUC with 1 Pull Request.

    ---Project #4 - Ruby Notificator---

    ![Ruby Notificator project](ruby-notifier.png)

    [Ruby Notificator](https://github.com/athityakumar/ruby-notificator) is a 
    project that aims to keep collecting and aggregating the user's social media 
    data (from Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) via APIs, and mail the 
    user regularly (say, everyday) about new notifications from various 
    platforms. This project is pretty much in the early stage. 

    - [Sayan Sinha](https://github.com/americast/) added support for mailing 
    the notifications of GitHub, with 3 Pull Requests. 

    ---Project #5 - GYFT--- 

    ![Get Your Freaking Timetabe](gyft.png)

    [GYFT](https://github.com/metakgp/gyft) is a gift to the students of IIT 
    Kharagpur, who would like to keep their Timetable from their ERP account 
    synced with their Google Calender. However, contributions are yet to be 
    reviewed and hence, no Pull Request has been merged so far.

    ---Conclusion---

    A huge token of thanks to Kharagpur Open Source Society for providing this 
    kind of an opportunity to mentor in open source projects. For the experiences 
    from the other side of the grass, have a look at the blog posts written by 
    student members who worked in my projects.
