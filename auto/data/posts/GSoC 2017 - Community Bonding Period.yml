    Community Bonding Period is roughly a 4-week period before the coding period
    wherein the selected GSoC students and mentors get to know more about each 
    other, and also discuss more about the project implementation. This year, 
    SciRuby ( [GitHub](https://github.com/SciRuby/) | 
    [Website](http://sciruby.com/) ) has selected 3 students - 
    [Prasun](https://github.com/prasunanand), [Shekar](https://github.com/Shekharrajak) 
    and myself. As Shekhar & myself were selected for the same project idea, we 
    had to split the project idea into 2 components and re-draft our timeline 
    schedules. 

    A consensus was reached that the project will be split into two parts namely 
    `daru-io` and `daru-view`, with the former being done by me and the latter 
    being done by Shekhar. 

    ---Video Conference #1---
    
    - Attendees : Shekhar & Myself
    - Date : 8th May 2017
    - Time : 4:15PM - 5:15PM IST 

    Through this one hour long discussion, we shared the main highlights of each 
    other's proposals that help with my daru-io part as well as Shakhar's 
    daru-view part. We also had a discussion regarding which libraries could be 
    used for various use cases, and whether we could integrate daru-io and 
    daru-views through a use-case like a 'Download' option in Ruby web frameworks 
    like Rails. 

    ---Video Conference #2---

    - Attendees : Shekhar & Myself
    - Date : 12th May 2017
    - Time : 4:30PM - 5:50PM IST 

    This discussion was essentially a continuation of the previous video 
    conference. We discussed more regarding adding more features in the same 
    timeline, now that our work has been split well. The consensus was to add 
    more support to both daru-io and daru-views. That is, more Import-Export 
    modules will be added to `daru-io` during the colloborated timeline, while more 
    plotting library support will be added to `daru-view`. 

    ---Video Conference #3---

    - Attendees : Sameer, Victor, Shekhar & Myself
    - Date : 24th May 2017
    - Time : 7:10PM - 8:40PM IST 

    Through this video conference, we discussed about both our re-drafted 
    proposals with mentors [Sameer](https://github.com/v0dro/) and 
    [Victor](https://github.com/zverok). By running through our proposal week 
    by week and module by module, we made sure that our timelines have been 
    re-drafted feasibly, and without any clashes. The colloborated proposal now 
    has the following deliverables : 

    - Daru-IO gem repository, with 
      1. Setups : Rspec, Rubocop, Yard docs and Travis CI
      2. Importers : HTML, Redis, JSON, Mongo, Avro, Rdata
      3. Exporters : CSV, Excel, JSON, Avro, Rdata
    - A Sample Rails Application showing usage of daru, daru-io and daru-views
      gems.

    This was an offline meetup that took place between GSoCers from Chennai, to
    discuss about their projects, coding, colleges, TV series and what not! It 
    was good to meet a couple of like-minded people with similar interests.
