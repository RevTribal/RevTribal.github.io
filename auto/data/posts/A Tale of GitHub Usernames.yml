title:  A Tale of GitHub Usernames

short_desc:  Why did Bruce Wayne call himself Batman, or Barry Allen call himself the Flash? Nicknames and alter egos in general, have a wide variety of interesting origin stories. This post is an honest attempt to crowd-source, collect and document the information about how the GitHub handles described in this post, came into existence.

    Ever wondered what could be the possible reason behind the different 
    usernames / alter egos of people around you? Well, it is this eerie mystery 
    that this blog post aims to cover, around my circle of friends and mentors -
    at least, on the GitHub platform. Before starting with the actual blog post, 
    I'd like to provide you with spoiler alert to some memes that have been 
    picked up from the scenes of TV series - 'The Flash' and 'Breaking Bad'.

    ---Not all heroes wear a mask---

    ![Say my name](say_my_name.gif) 

    Indeed. There are many users who prefer to have a mainstream username, which 
    directly exposes their name. The most common reason behind this is that, a 
    mainstream username looks more 'official' at first sight. Need I give any 
    explanation for the below handles?

    - [@kaustubhhiware](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware) (Kaustubh Hiware) 
    - [@nishnik](https://github.com/nishnik) (Nishant Nikhil)
    - [@lokeshh](https://github.com/lokeshh) (Lokesh Sharma)
    - [@hargup](https://github.com/hargup) (Harsh Gupta)
    - [@Shekharrajak](https://github.com/Shekharrajak) (Shekhar Prasad Rajak)

    Infact, I myself belong to this category. My GitHub username is 
    [@athityakumar](https://github.com/athityakumar) - and I went for a 
    mainstream username because my name was already spelled weirdly 
    enough, that I didn't even have to think of a more weirder username.

    ---Some heroes wear a psuedo-mask---

    ![Not Bad](not_bad.gif)

    By a psuedo-mask, I mean that these usernames reveal the user's name - but 
    it's not just the name that is being revealed. 

    - [@kshitij10496](https://github.com/kshitij10496) (Kshitij Saraogi) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Kshitij truly believes that the 
        Date of Birth of an individual is something that makes the individual 
        unique, and has hence included his Date of Birth (10/04/1996) in his 
        username.</span>

    - [@vivekiitkgp](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp) (Vivek Rai) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Vivek Rai is a (final-year) 
        student of IIT Kharagpur, and has hence added the Institute name 
        (iitkgp) to his username.</span>

    - [@shivani29456](https://github.com/shivani29456) (Shivani Sharma) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Shivani had obtained an 
        All India Rank of 29456 in JEE(Mains) - one of the most competitive 
        college entrance exams in India. Hence, she has added it in her username.
        </span>

    ---Some heroes love string manipulation---

    ![Cooler](cooler_name.gif)

    These are the usernames from which the user's name can't be guessed 
    directly - but a corelation between the name and username can certainly be 
    derived.

    - [@geremih](https://github.com/geremih) (Mihir Rege) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> The 'Rege' in the name has 
        been transformed to 'gere' in the username, and 'mih' from Mihir has 
        been added at the end. Hence, the username - @geremih.</span>
    
    - [@amrav](https://github.com/amrav) (Vikrant Varma) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Simply reverse the last name 'Varma' 
        and behold - it's @amrav.</span>

    - [@raincrash](https://github.com/raincrash) (Sri Charan) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Time to play Anagrams! 
        The letters in the name have been smartly rearranged to provide 
        the username, which even looks meaningful.</span>

    ---Some heroes prefer a secret identity---

    ![Keeps getting cooler](keeps_getting_cooler.gif) 

    The usernames below have no relation whatsoever to the user's name, and a 
    corelation can't be drawn even after the user's name is known. In most 
    cases, only the user knows the story behind their username.

    - [@zverok](https://github.com/zverok) (Victor Shepelev) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> 'zverok' has been the default username 
        of Victor for nearly the past 15 years. The username has Russian 
        origins, and it means 'a small beast' in Russian (зверёк). Seemingly, 
        this username was selected randomly from the absurd play(s) that 
        Victor had written with his friends of that time.</span>

    - [@DefCon-007](https://github.com/DefCon-007) (Ayush Goyal) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> DefCon is the largest hacking convention, 
        held annually at Las Vegas - Ayush first took this as his nickname for 
        Counter-Strike gaming within the Institute. But as this username was 
        already taken on GitHub, Ayush added the James Bond number '007', 
        and made himself known as 'DefCon-007' on GitHub.</span>

    - [@americast](https://github.com/americast) (Sayan Sinha) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Sayan had crafted this nickname in his 
        5th grade itself. During one of the Geography lectures, he came across 
        the different Timezones, and was more attracted to the American Standard 
        Time more than Indian Standard Time. Hence, he had decided that he'd keep 
        himself as @americanst in the digital world to not showcase any details 
        about him. However, a typo while creating his first Yahoo account made 
        sure that he'd rather be called as @americast on all social media 
        platforms. Although a typo, @americast does sound more cooler than 
        @americanst - so, I guess it can be considered a 'Wonder Blunder'.</span>

    - [@ghostwriternr](https://github.com/ghostwriternr) (Naresh Ramesh) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Many years ago, Naresh had 
        chosen 'ghost_000' as his first linux user account name. He was also a 
        part of Technology Literary Society of IIT Kharagpur due to his interest 
        in writing. Hence, combining `ghost' from linux username, 'writer' from 
        writing, 'n' from Naresh and 'r' from Ramesh, the username 
        'ghostwriternr' was born.</span>

    - [@the-ethan-hunt](https://github.com/the-ethan-hunt) (Dhruv Apte) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Being a fan of the 'Mission Impossible' 
        set of movies, Dhruv named himself as 'Ethan Hunt' in one of the Mini 
        Militia gaming marathon in his Institute. Gradually rising among the 
        ranks in the game, Dhruv got a good vibe from this nickname and went on 
        to change his presence in all social media platforms to Ethan Hunt. 
        Wanting to be unique, he chose the username 'the-ethan-hunt'. </span>

    - [@zorroblue](https://github.com/zorroblue) (Rameshwar Bhaskaran) -
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Being a hardcore fan of 
        Beyblade's Kai and Zorro animated series, he wanted a username like Kai / 
        Zorro. However, both Kai and Zorro usernames were already taken on 
        GitHub. Hence, he combined Zorro, with his favourite color (Blue) - 
        resulting in @zorroblue.</span>

    - [@Parth-Vader](https://github.com/Parth-Vader) (Parth Verma) -
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> This is pretty obvious. Being 
        a Star Wars fan, Parth combined his first name with the last name of the 
        most powerful Jedi that ever lived (Vader from Darth Vader) to end up 
        with his username @Parth-Vader.</span>

        ![What if this is how I become Vader?](vader.gif) 

    #### Oh, and here are the 'BROs at OSS' - ie, real-life brothers who're doing big at open-source.

    - [@OrkoHunter](https://github.com/OrkoHunter) (Himanshu Mishra) -
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Being another fan of the 'Mission 
        Impossible' movies, Himanshu wanted a nickname that included Hunt / 
        Hunter. However, as Hunter seemed like a surname, he began searching for 
        a first name that he could use with Hunter. After literally searching for 
        'Worst Cartoon Charecters', the then Google redirected him to 
        [this](http://monster10.com/The-10-Worst-Cartoon-Characters-Ever.htm) 
        page. Being the lazy guy he is, he chose the the cartoon character 
        which was shown on the top of that page rather than scrolling 
        down - Orko. This is how @OrkoHunter came into existence.</span>

    - [@debugger22](https://github.com/debugger22) (Sudhanshu Mishra) -
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Combining 'debugger' and his 
        date of birth (22), the username @debugger22 made it's way into the 
        GitHub world and went on to create GitHub-Audio ( 
        [Website](https://github.audio/) | 
        [Repository](https://github.com/debugger22/github-audio) 
        ).</span>

    ---But when secret identity is too much a secret...---

    ![Cool at naming things](cool_at_naming.gif)

    When secret identity becomes too much a secret, even the users themselves 
    can't come up with a legit reason for their username. Readers are welcome to
    share their own fan-fiction theories about how the below usernames might 
    have come into existence, in the comment section below.

    - [@icyflame](https://github.com/icyflame) (Siddharth Kannan) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Though Siddharth claims that he hadn't 
        come across 'A Song of Ice and Fire' novel before fixing his username, 
        the username 'icy' (Ice) + 'flame' (Fire) does perfectly blend in with 
        this novel's name.</span>

    - [@v0dro](https://github.com/v0dro) (Sameer Deshmukh) - 
        <span style='font-weight:100;'> Sameer was once interning in a 
        company, when his boss asked him what he'd like to call himself on 
        GitHub. For some 'unknown' reason, Sameer chose @v0dro as his handle, and 
        started to like it ever since. It's also noteworthy to mention that he 
        also went on to start the project [Daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru) 
        (Acronym of Data Analysis in RUby, and also coincidentally the Hindi word 
        for Booze), which has been taken under the patronage of 
        SciRuby organization.</span>

    ---Conclusion---

    A huge token of thanks to everyone who shared the story behind their GitHub 
    username! It was really an interesting experience for me to get to know 
    about the various origin stories of usernames, and I hope it is equally 
    interesting for the readers too. If possible, I'll try to come up with a 
    part-2 of this post which may not be restricted to just GitHub usernames. 
    If you'd like to get your story featured in that post, shoot me a mail at
