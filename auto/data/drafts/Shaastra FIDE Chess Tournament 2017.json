Through this post, I'd also like to explain about how this blog has been built. This blog is different from the other blogs in both - choice of UI framework and method of pages generation. <a href='http://semantic-ui.com/' target=_blank'>Semantic-UI</a>, a new and growing front-end framework has been chosen as the front-end framework, leaving behind other usual frameworks such as <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a> , <a href='http://materializecss.com/' target='_blank'>MaterializeCSS</a> , <a href='http://foundation.zurb.com/' target='_blank'>Zurb Foundation</a>. And I've kind of re-invented the wheel by producing the same functionalities of <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a>, but with just a hand-made Ruby script.</p> <p> So, what all does this Ruby script do?  </p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li> Remove the previously generated <code>blog/</code> directory. <li> Read through the <code>data/</code> folder, for blog posts. </li> <li> Create corresponding <code>posts/</code> , <code>tags/</code> and <code>page{i}</code> sub-directories.</li><li>Generate proper <code>index.html</code> files in all sub-directories from ERB templates, with proper back-linking to other entities.</li><li>Add DisQus comment section to all blog posts.</li><li> Add functional search boxes for both posts and tags.</li><li> Provide proper messages for each action, on Terminal.<br><br><img class='ui big centered image'><br><img class='ui big centered image'></li> </ul></h4><p>Yet, there are some improvements left to be done - </p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li> Read data from configuration files (equivalent of Jekyll's <code>_config.yml</code>).</li><li> Setup intelligent <code>< meta ></code> tags for SEO.</li></ul></h4><p> So, that's the end of this post, folks.  For the attention of fellow developers, you can find the codes at the <a href='https://github.com/athityakumar/athityakumar.github.io' target=_blank'>GitHub repository</a>.
